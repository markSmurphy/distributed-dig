## Overview

A utility which makes DNS lookup requests across multiple DNS resolvers and collates the results.

Useful for checking if a DNS record has been fully propagated, or for querying the origins behind an [AWS Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-types.html) / [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/traffic-manager/) record (*or any other DNS-based load balancing solution*).

---

## Installation

Installing globally is recommended:

```text
npm install -g distributed-dig
```

---

## Usage

```text
ddig domain [domain [domain] ...] [options]
```

---

## Options

The following options are available:

```text
--port <number>                  Specify the DNS port [53]
--protocol <upd|tcp>             Specify the DNS protocol [udp]
--timeout <number>               Specify the DNS timeout in milliseconds [2500]
--edns <true|false>              Enable or disable EDNS(0) [false]
--config <filename>              Specify an alternative configuration file
--list-resolvers                 List resolvers configured in config file
--list-options                   List DNS request options configured in config file
--list-defaults                  Print json of default config file settings
--verbose                        Outputs more information
--no-color                       Switches off colour output
--version                        Display version number
--help                           Display this help
```

### port

Specify the TCP/UDP port tro use when connecting to the DNS resolver.
Default: `53`

### protocol

Specify whether to use UDP or TCP when connecting to the DNS resolver.
Default: `udp`

### timeout

Specifies the timeout in milliseconds to wait for a response from each DNS resolver.
Default: `2500` (*2.5 seconds*)

### edns

Enables [EDNS(0)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_mechanisms_for_DNS)
Default: `false` (*disabled*)

With EDNS(0) enabled, if an upstream resolver doesn't support it then the standard DNS will be used as a fallback.
*Even though EDNS is support by ~90% of resolvers on the internet [^1], it is disabled by default in `ddig` as it may cause the resolver to return the IP address it considers closest to you, which is counter-productive to the purpose of querying many geographically distributed DNS resolvers.*

[^1]: [Internet Systems Consortium - Partial EDNS Compliance Hampers Deployment of New DNS Features](https://www.isc.org/blogs/partial-edns-compliance-hampers-deployment-of-new-dns-features/)

### config

Specifies an alternative configuration file.

To create a custom config you can:

1. pipe **--list-defaults** to a new file: `ddig --list-defaults > custom.json`
2. Edit `custom.json`
3. Use the new configuration file: `ddig --config [path]custom.json example.com`

### list-resolvers

Lists the resolvers configured in the `distributed-dig.json` config file:

![ddig --list-resolvers](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.list-resolvers.gif)

### list-options

Lists the options configured in the `distributed-dig.json` config file:

![ddig --list-options](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.list-options.gif)

### list-defaults

Prints out a sample default config file in raw json.  Pipe it to a file for an initial customised configuration file.

### verbose

Switches on verbose mode which outputs the following additional fields:

* Full recursive answer (i.e. nested `cname` records)
* Resolver IP Address
* Response time

![ddig www.asos.com --verbose](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.single.domain.www.asos.com.verbose.gif)

`--verbose` also modifies the `--list-resolvers` and `--list-options` switches.

### no-color

If your terminal has problems rendering the colour output then you can switch it off by using `--no-color`.

### version

Prints out `distributed-dig`'s version number.

### help

Displays the help screen:

![`ddig --help`](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.help.gif)

---

## Examples

### Lookup a single domain

* List the IP address returned for `www.asos.com` from each of the configured resolver:

```text
ddig www.asos.com
```

![ddig www.asos.com](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.example.01.png)

### Lookup a single domain with verbose enabled

* List the IP address and full recursive path returned for `www.asos.com` from each of the configured resolver:

```text
ddig www.asos.com --verbose
```

![ddig www.asos.com --verbose](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.example.02.png)

### Lookup multiple domains with an increased timeout

* List the IP addresses returned for both `www.asos.com` & `secure.asos.com` from each of the configured resolver with a 5 second timeout:

```text
ddig www.asos.com my.asos.com secure.asos.com --timeout 5000
```

![ddig www.asos.com my.asos.com secure.asos.com](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.example.03.png)

---

## Features

### Unique IP Address Identifier

The first occurrence of each unique IP address is marked by a bullet point:

![ddig unique IP Address Identifier](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.unique.png)

#### Unicode Support

The bullet point character used is `U+2022 â€¢ BULLET (HTML &#8226;)`.  If it is detected that the output is being piped (to a file or to `more` | `cat`) then the ascii character `42 * Asterisk (HTML &ast;)`

### Column Width Warning

If you use the `--verbose` switch and have a terminal window that's narrower than 130 columns you'll see a warning:

![ddig column width warning](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ddig.width.warning.png)

---

## Configuration File

All Options and Resolvers are configured in `distributed-dig.json` file.  This file can exist in any of the following locations:

* The current working directory - `node -p process.cwd()`
* The home directory - `node -p require('os').homedir()`
* The application's root directory (i.e. the same directory as `distributed-dig.js`)

### Request Options

The default options are:

```json
"options": {
    "request": {
      "port": 53,
      "type": "udp",
      "timeout": 2500,
      "try_edns": false,
      "cache": false
    },
    "question": {
      "type": "A"
    }
}
```

### DNS Resolvers

Resolvers are configured in an array with each resolver having a `nameServer` element which should be the IPv4 or IPv6 address, and a `provider` element which is just a free-form text label:

```json
"resolvers": [
    {
      "nameServer": "208.67.222.222",
      "provider": "OpenDNS (Primary)"
    },
    {
      "nameServer": "208.67.220.220",
      "provider": "OpenDNS (Secondary)"
    },
    {
      "nameServer": "217.199.173.113",
      "provider": "United Kingdom"
    }
]
```

You can find a list of public DNS servers [here](https://public-dns.info/) and tailor the configured list for your own requirements.

`distributed-dig` uses the npm package [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug "www.npmjs.com").  If you set the environment variable `debug` to `ddig` you'll see full debug output.

### Windows

```text
set debug=ddig
```

### Linux

```text
DEBUG=ddig
```

### Powershell

```text
$env:debug="ddig"
```

* Appended a unit suffix to the `TTL` value.

#### Changed

* Removed `moment` as a dependency and refactored time difference calculations to be handled natively.
* Increased the recommended columns width to 140 when using the `--verbose` switch,  allowing for the new 'TTL' and `record type` columns.

---

### [1.4.2] - June 14<sup>th</sup> 2020

#### Changed

* Fixed a bug causing the `Record Type` to be `Unknown` due to erroneously locating the json lookup file when install globally.
