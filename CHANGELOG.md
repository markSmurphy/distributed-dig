---

## [1.3.0] - February 14<sup>th</sup> 2020

### Changed

* Fixed `npm-shrinkwrap.json` problem that prevented `npm update` succeeding.

---

### Changed

* Use * instead of unicode character â€¢ to signify unique IP address when `process.stdout.isTTY` is `false` [^1].
* Updated Dependencies.
* Shrink-wrapped `npm` dependencies.

[^1]: When `process.stdout.isTTY` is `false` it signifies that the output is being piped or redirected. There's no guarantee that the target of the pipe (e.g. `more` on Windows, for screen pagination) or the redirect (e.g. a text file) has unicode support so we refrain from outputting any unicode.
