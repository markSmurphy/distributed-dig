### Changed

* Shrink-wrapped `npm` dependencies.

[^1]: When `process.stdout.isTTY` is `false` it signifies that the output is being piped or redirected. There's no guarantee that the target of the pipe (e.g. `more` on Windows, for screen pagination) or the redirect (e.g. a text file) has unicode support so we refrain from outputting any unicode.
